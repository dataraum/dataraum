// Config→DB (DAT-728): the concept vocabulary is the typed `concepts` table, not
// `config_overlay` rows. A framed / directory-less vertical has NO on-disk
// `ontology.yaml`, so its concepts come ONLY from the rows the frame stage writes
// here (source='frame'). With none declared, the engine fails loud deep in
// `semantic_per_column` (semantic_per_column_phase.py) — a dead Temporal run the
// user can't read. The trigger uses this count (added to the on-disk count in
// verticalConceptCount) to refuse early with a "run frame first" message instead
// of starting a doomed run. A shipped vertical's seed rows aren't written until
// the pipeline runs, so at pre-flight its on-disk count is what clears the guard.
