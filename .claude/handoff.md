# Calibration Handoff

Changes in dataraum-context that need attention in other repos.

Updated by `/implement` in this repo. Read by `/accept` in dataraum-eval.

## 2026-03-26: DAT-195 — server-level ConnectionManager, pipeline source_id fix

### dataraum-eval
- **Changed**: `src/dataraum/mcp/server.py`, `src/dataraum/core/connections.py` (1 line: investigation model import)
- **Affects**: all MCP tools (look, measure, begin_session, query, run_sql, add_source)
- **Calibrate**: re-run MCP smoke tests. The eval harness calls `_measure` — if it patched `get_manager_for_directory`, that patch path no longer exists. Harness needs to call `_measure(session, ...)` directly or go through `call_tool`.
- **Notes**:
  - `_run_pipeline` always uses multi-source mode now (`source_path=None`). The eval harness `_load_gate_scores` migration (mentioned in memory) needs to account for this: pipeline runs create a "multi_source" Source, not a source named after the file path.
  - `_resolve_source_path` and `_get_cached_contract` deleted — if eval patches these, remove the patches.
  - Handler signatures changed: `_measure(session, target)`, `_look(session, target, sample, *, cursor)`, etc.
  - `measure` response now shows `status: "running"` with `phases_completed` during pipeline runs (previously returned `pipeline_triggered` repeatedly).
- **Status**: pending

### Known issues (not in this handoff)
- DAT-197: measure target filter bugs (readiness prefix mismatch, short table names don't match). S-size fix pending.
- DAT-196: session model redesign (workspace vs. session isolation). Design doc published, blocked by DAT-197.

## YYYY-MM-DD: brief description

### dataraum-eval
- **Changed**: files, modules, behaviors
- **Affects**: which MCP tools, detectors, or pipeline phases
- **Calibrate**: which eval tests, skills, or strategies to run
- **Notes**: context the eval session needs (e.g., new response fields, changed thresholds)
- **Status**: pending | verified | failed

### dataraum-testdata (hints)
- **Suggestion**: directional hints for new injections, ground truth values, or scenarios
- **Rationale**: why this would improve test coverage
(Keep these directional — testdata has its own design concerns)
