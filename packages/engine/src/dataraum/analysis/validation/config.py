"""Loader for validation specs — the typed DB home, overlay-aware (DAT-735).

Reads the workspace's validation vocabulary from the typed ``validations`` home
(:mod:`~dataraum.analysis.validation.validation_store`: seed ``⊕`` generated rows)
``⊕`` the ``validation`` teach overlay applied at read time. This replaces the raw
YAML directory walk: the shipped YAML is now the SEED source, normalized into typed
rows at connect (``ensure_validations_seeded``), and agentic induction adds
``source='generated'`` rows — so a *framed* vertical whose validations exist only as
rows is served identically to a builtin, and the teach overlay ``⊕`` layer keeps
working.

An explicit ``verticals_dir`` (tests / fixtures) reads raw YAML and bypasses BOTH the
DB home and the overlay — the same escape hatch the pre-DAT-735 loader offered.

    Production (``session`` given): reads the active ``validations`` rows (seed ``⊕``
    generated) as the config→DB base, then layers the ``validation`` teach overlay
    over it (upsert-replace by ``validation_id``, the same
    :func:`~dataraum.core.overlay.apply_overlay` machinery). Replacement is
    WHOLESALE — deliberately: an overlay row is a full respec of the check, so one
    that omits ``relevant_conventions`` validates to ``[]`` and drops a generated
    row's declared convention dependencies (the bind then falls back to
    targets-routed conventions only, and ``validation_phase`` has no missing-id to
    warn about). An unknown / framed vertical with no rows and no overlay resolves
    to an EMPTY dict, never raises — "no declared validations" is the phase tier's
    loud outcome.

    Tests (``verticals_dir`` given): reads raw YAML under that root and bypasses BOTH
    the DB home and the overlay.

    Neither given: returns EMPTY (a caller with no DB session has no typed home to
