"""Lifecycle artifact model — the typed artifact lifecycle substrate (DAT-438).

The journey's artifacts (validations in slice 1; cycles and metrics in later
operating_model slices) move through the typed lifecycle of
``architecture-future.md``: ``declared`` → ``grounded`` → ``executed`` are
*system* states, ``canonical`` is the *organizational* state reached only
through the (not yet built) endorsement workflow. This table is the general
substrate; the state machine and stage authorization live in
:mod:`dataraum.lifecycle.transitions`.

Versioning contract (DAT-408/413 + ADR-0008):

* **Append-only across runs** — a re-run supersedes by writing new rows under
  its fresh ``run_id``; a prior run's rows are never mutated. Within the
  *active* run the row's ``state`` advances in place (declared → grounded →
  executed happen during one ``OperatingModelWorkflow`` run on one row); the
  identity UNIQUE makes that one row per ``(type, key, run)``.
* **Born view-ready** — ``run_id``-stamped under the workspace catalog head
  (target ``catalog``, stage ``operating_model``), so the ADR-0008
  ``current_*`` view generator covers it with the standard head join; no
  reader needs hand-rolled head resolution.

Provenance lives ON the row (refine decision D2 — no edge table in slice 1):
``grounded_against`` snapshots the pinned base-run map the artifact was bound
against, ``teaches`` names what produced it (spec id, vertical, spec version),
``strictness`` records the journey parameter (nullable — frame does not write
it yet, and nothing gates on it; refine decision D3).
