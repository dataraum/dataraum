"""Operating-model property graph over real Postgres 19 (ADR-0021, DAT-726).

Seeds one controlled, fully-promoted workspace (deterministic — no pipeline, no
LLM), materializes the read views + the property graph exactly as the engine
bootstrap does, then exercises the P1 acceptance criteria on the live SQL/PGQ
engine:

* the graph binds over the ``current_*`` views (element views + CREATE PROPERTY
  GRAPH succeed);
* a PGQ ``MATCH`` returns correct rows — every measure column → its stock/flow
  materialization, seeded with the REAL pipeline vocabularies;
* ``derived_from`` edges are enumerable (enriched view → fact + dim bases);
* the ``cockpit_reader`` role can query the graph (a property graph needs its own
  GRANT — table grants don't reach GRAPH_TABLE);
* the two-mechanism query model is de-risked on a chain that OUTRUNS the depth cap
  and contains a cycle: the bounded recursive-CTE closure truncates at the cap
  (a node one hop past it stays unreached), the cycle guard fires (a back edge
  never re-enters its source) and the walk terminates, and the fixed-depth PGQ
  unroll agrees with the closure at the same depth;
* the drop-before-refresh bootstrap is idempotent across a re-boot.

These are the live half of ADR-0021; the pure DDL-shape tests live in
``tests/unit/storage/test_property_graph.py``.
