# Calibration Handoff

Changes in dataraum-context that need attention in other repos.

Updated by `/implement` in this repo. Read by `/accept` in dataraum-eval.

## 2026-03-26: DAT-195 — server-level ConnectionManager, pipeline source_id fix

### dataraum-eval
- **Changed**: `src/dataraum/mcp/server.py`, `src/dataraum/core/connections.py` (1 line: investigation model import)
- **Affects**: all MCP tools (look, measure, begin_session, query, run_sql, add_source)
- **Calibrate**: re-run MCP smoke tests. The eval harness calls `_measure` — if it patched `get_manager_for_directory`, that patch path no longer exists. Harness needs to call `_measure(session, ...)` directly or go through `call_tool`.
- **Notes**:
  - `_run_pipeline` always uses multi-source mode now (`source_path=None`). The eval harness `_load_gate_scores` migration (mentioned in memory) needs to account for this: pipeline runs create a "multi_source" Source, not a source named after the file path.
  - `_resolve_source_path` and `_get_cached_contract` deleted — if eval patches these, remove the patches.
  - Handler signatures changed: `_measure(session, target)`, `_look(session, target, sample, *, cursor)`, etc.
  - `measure` response now shows `status: "running"` with `phases_completed` during pipeline runs (previously returned `pipeline_triggered` repeatedly).
- **Status**: pending

## 2026-03-26: DAT-197 — measure/look target filter fixes

### dataraum-eval
- **Changed**: `src/dataraum/mcp/server.py` — `_resolve_table_name` helper, `_look` and `_measure` target resolution rewritten
- **Affects**: measure and look tools when called with target parameter
- **Calibrate**: re-run any smoke tests that use short table names or filter by target
- **Notes**:
  - Short table names now resolve via suffix match: `"invoices"` → `"zone1__invoices"`. Ambiguous names (matching multiple tables) return error.
  - `measure(target=...)` now returns error for nonexistent tables/columns (previously returned empty results silently).
  - Readiness filter fixed: keys have `"column:"` prefix, filter now accounts for it. Readiness populates correctly when target is specified.
  - Scores are now recomputed from filtered points when target is specified (previously returned dataset-wide averages regardless of target).
- **Status**: pending

### dataraum-eval (calibration concerns)
- **Observation**: outlier_rate detector scores 1.0 on 5 columns (invoices.amount, payments.amount, journal_lines.credit, fx_rates.rate, trial_balance.debit_balance). Score 1.0 means maximum entropy — likely a detector threshold issue, not actual data quality.
- **Observation**: temporal_drift scores 1.0 on bank_transactions.amount. Same concern.
- **Action**: calibration tests should verify these detectors against ground truth in entropy_map.yaml. If no injection exists for these columns, the detector is producing false positives.

### Known issues (not in this handoff)
- DAT-196: session model redesign (workspace vs. session isolation). Design doc published, blocked by DAT-197.

<!--
## YYYY-MM-DD: brief description

### dataraum-eval
- **Changed**: files, modules, behaviors
- **Affects**: which MCP tools, detectors, or pipeline phases
- **Calibrate**: which eval tests, skills, or strategies to run
- **Notes**: context the eval session needs (e.g., new response fields, changed thresholds)
- **Status**: pending | verified | failed

### dataraum-testdata (hints)
- **Suggestion**: directional hints for new injections, ground truth values, or scenarios
- **Rationale**: why this would improve test coverage
(Keep these directional — testdata has its own design concerns)
