"""Worker I/O contracts (DAT-344; identity collapsed to ``RunRef`` in DAT-506/426).

Deliberately engine-free: imports nothing but the stdlib + Pydantic. Both the
activity runner (:mod:`dataraum.worker.activity`, which pulls in the whole engine)
and the workflows (:mod:`dataraum.worker.workflows`, which run in Temporal's
determinism sandbox) import these models from here — so the workflow module never
drags SQLAlchemy/DuckDB/the registry into the sandbox.

The wire identity is **source-free and session-free** (DAT-506/426): there is no
``SourceIdentity``/``SessionIdentity`` envelope and no ``session_id``/``source_id``
on the identity. Activities are threaded with a minimal :class:`RunRef`
(``workspace_id`` + the run's ``run_id``). A source id appears on the wire in
exactly ONE place — the ``import`` activity's explicit ``source_id`` argument,
which runs before any ``Table`` row exists and so cannot resolve relationally.
Every phase past import is table-scoped or run-scoped and resolves source
provenance relationally via ``tables.source_id`` (the FK on the row).

The workspace ``verticals`` (frame ontologies, by name) ride on the workflow
INPUT contracts — the driver sources them from ``workspaces`` (cockpit-owned) and
the per-call activities read the resolved name off their phase config.

The shapes are **typed per boundary**, not one uniform envelope: ``import``
discovers raw tables, ``typing`` mints a typed id, the analytics phases are
scoped to a single typed table, the begin_session phases to the whole selection.
