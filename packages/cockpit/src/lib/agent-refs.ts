// Model-only refs parts (DAT-423 upload handoff, generalized for DAT-437).
//
// A UI surface that composes a chat turn often needs to hand the agent an
// internal identifier (an s3:// uri, a table_id, a column_id) — but raw ids
// must NEVER appear in the visible user bubble. The pattern: the turn carries
// TWO text parts —
//   1. a CLEAN bubble (human names only) the chat rail renders, and
//   2. a marked REFS part (the structured internals) the model reads but every
//      user-part renderer skips (`isAgentRefsPart`).
// Self-contained on the message — no side-channel state to thread or clear.
//
// Any surface that renders user message parts (the chat rail today; a future
// transcript export, copy-to-clipboard, debug panel) MUST apply the same skip,
// or the internals leak.
//
// DAT-452 — the AG-UI event layer was explored as a replacement and REJECTED:
// a sanctioned, typed client→server channel DOES exist (`sendMessage(content,
// body)` → wire `forwardedProps` → `chatParamsFromRequest().forwardedProps`),
// but it is per-REQUEST. Refs must stay model-visible across LATER turns
// (chat is in-memory; the client re-sends `messages[]` each request, and the
// model resolves "the file I uploaded earlier" from history) — the marker
// gets that for free by riding IN the message, while forwardedProps would
// need a client-side refs store replayed on every send: exactly the
// side-channel state this design exists to avoid. Persistent model-visible
// context is what MESSAGES are for; the marker is the protocol-correct fit.
// (Server→client CUSTOM events — `ctx.emitCustomEvent` → `onCustomEvent` —
// flow the wrong direction for refs; they're the live tool-progress channel.)

// Both halves of `RefsTurn` are PUBLIC SDK exports (DAT-449): the message
// shape from @tanstack/ai-client, the content-part shape from the
// @tanstack/ai/client subpath — no hand-mirrored field shapes to drift.
